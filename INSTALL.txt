This is a modified version of the QtSpeech library that supports
the MinGW compiler on Windows, for use by the Speech module of
Tao Presentations (http://taodyne.com).

This library contains:
- Source code from: http://gitorious.org/qt-speech, covered by the
LGPL license (see file headers and LICENSE_LGPL.txt).
- Files derived from the Goldendict application
https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict, covered by the GPLv3
license (see LICENSE_GPL.txt).
Therefore the license for the whole library is GPLv3.

To build the library, you need the Tao Presentations SDK which is bundled
with the free version of the application (get it from http://taodyne.com).
Clone the project under <SDK root>/speech/qt-speech then run configure
and type "make ; make install" in the qt-speech directory.

Enjoy,
